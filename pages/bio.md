Throughout my career, I’ve worked closely with energy companies to oversee programming and project delivery. Leveraging data analytics and a talent for problem solving, I consistently deliver high quality results that drive efficiency, cost-savings, and continuous improvement. 

The Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Data Science and Analytics that I recently completed at the University of Calgary has given me an in depth understanding of statistics, programming, big data, regression, visualization and machine learning.

Notable projects and career highlights include:

* Computer Vision - Created a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing TensorFlow / Keras on Google Cloud
* Housing Price Prediction – Linear & Elasticnet Regression Analysis, SVM, 80+ features (feature engineering)
* NHL Data Exploration & Analytics - Created interactive heat map of 300,000 events (shots on goal and goals).
* NHL Prediction Model Development – Leveraged NHL Data and logistic regression model.
* Hadoop & MapReduce Paradigm Presentation (Big Data) – Delivered 30-minute Class Presentation/Instruction.
* Spearheaded development of a customized compressor control program.

Additionally, my practical experience is complemented by a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, and proficiencies in Data Science, Data Cleaning, Data Mining, and Software Development.

## NHL Heatmap

---

This was an incredibly fun project. I had always wanted to see what the distribution of shots and goals looked like, but had never seen the visualization that I had envisioned in my mind. This project was my chance to realize my vision.

As it is difficult to show this project on a website here is a [link to the github repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-heatmap). Th

The project was completed in Jupyter Notebooks and uses plotly to draw the rink surface and generate the heat map. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to convert this project into a nice html page due to using the ipywidgets. I hope you take the opportunity to build this project yourself with the notebook I have provided so that you can play around with the interface and enjoy it as I have. I have provided some screen shots on the github `README.md` so that you can get a feel for the interface and the application.





## NHL Predictions

---

This was a group project and our goal was to create a Logistic Regression model to predict the winner of NHL hockey games. Hockey is a major interest of our team and sports are always a little more fun if you bet some money on them so those are the motivating factors for this project.

There are two main components to this project:

1. Preprocessing of data to prepare it for modelling. (Python)
2. Building the logistic regression model. (R)

The [final report](link://slug/nhl-prediction) that my team submitted cab accessed directly [here](link://slug/nhl-prediction). Additionally, all of the supporting code and analysis can be found at [the project github repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-prediction). I urge you to explore the [repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-prediction) for more information and a better insight into the work required to build the Logistic Regression model.



## Rock Climbing Analysis

---

There are two parts to this project:

1. [Data Story](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408) on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408). Please give it a read and I hope you enjoy it. It's intended to be consumed by a wide audience so it does not contain any of the source code.
2. [Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing) performed in support of the [data story](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408) can be found at the [github repository](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing).

The original data for this story can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook) and it was collected from the website [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/) on 9/13/2017 by David Cohen. I owe a large thanks to David for creating the dataset as without it this project wouldn't be possible.

### Who am I?

Throughout my career, I’ve been frequently engaged by large oil and gas companies to oversee programming and project delivery. Leveraging data analytics, technical programming skills, and a talent for problem solving, I consistently deliver high-impact results that drive efficiency, cost-savings, and quality improvements. 

I have completed a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Data Science and Analytics at the University of Calgary. I’ve completed coursework in Statistics, Programming, Big Data, Regression Analysis, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. 

Notable projects and career highlights include:

* Computer Vision - Created a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing TensorFlow / Keras on Google Cloud
* Housing Price Prediction – Linear & Elasticnet Regression Analysis, SVM, 80+ features (feature engineering)
* NHL Data Exploration & Analytics - Created interactive heat map of 300,000 events (shots on goal and goals).
* NHL Prediction Model Development – Leveraged NHL Data and logistic regression model.
* Hadoop & MapReduce Paradigm Presentation (Big Data) – Delivered 30-minute Class Presentation/Instruction.
* Spearheaded development of a customized compressor control program.

Additionally, my practical experience is complemented by a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, and proficiencies in Data Science, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Data Mining, and Software Development.

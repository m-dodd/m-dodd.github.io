# Who am I?

I graduated University of Alberta in 2002 with a B.Sc. Electrical Engineering Co-Op. I started working for a consulting company in Calgary called Kilowatts Design Ltd. It was a fantastic company to work for and eventually they got bought by Schneider Electric in 2013. I learned a lot working for them as an industrial automation engineer, but I never felt satisfied with what I was doing.

Add more later.

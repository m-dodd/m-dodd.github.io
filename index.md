Hi! My name is Mark Dodd and you've found my Data Science portfolio. 

On Mark's AI Adventures you will find out a bit more about me and explore a number of my favorite Data Science projects. I love analyzing data; using data to tell interesting informative stories; and using data to make meaningful predictions.

So, come on in, take a look around, and if reach out to me on. I'd love to hear from you.

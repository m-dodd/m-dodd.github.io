## NHL Heatmap

---

This was an incredibly fun project. I had always wanted to see what the distribution of shots and goals looked like, but had never seen the visualization that I had envisioned in my mind. This project was my chance to realize my vision.

The project was completed in Jupyter Notebooks and uses plotly to draw the rink surface and generate the heat map. Unfortunately, I have not found a way to convert this project into a nice html page due to using the ipywidgets. I hope you take the opportunity to build this project yourself with the notebook I have provided so that you can play around with the interface and enjoy it as I have. I have provided some screen shots on the github `README.md` so that you can get a feel for the interface and the application.

As it is difficult to show this project on a website here is a [link to the github repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-heatmap).



## NHL Predictions

---

This was a group project and our goal was to create a Logistic Regression model to predict the winner of NHL hockey games. Hockey is a major interest of our team and sports are always a little more fun if you bet some money on them so those are the motivating factors for this project.

There are two main components to this project:

1. Preprocessing of data to prepare it for modelling. (Python)
2. Building the logistic regression model. (R)

You can read the [final report](link://slug/nhl-prediction) that my team submitted [here](link://slug/nhl-prediction).

Additionally, all of the supporting code and analysis can be found at [the project github repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-prediction). I urge you to explore the [repo](https://github.com/m-dodd/nhl-prediction) for more information and a better insight into the work required to build the Logistic Regression model.



## Rock Climbing Analysis

---

There are two parts to this project:

1. [Data Story](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408) on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408). Please give it a read - it doesn't even contain any code.
2. [Data cleaning, wrangling and analysis](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing) performed in support of the [data story](https://medium.com/@buckthecanuck/climb-through-the-data-with-me-80fb144ea408).

All of the data, cleaning, and analysis was performed in Python and can be found on my [github repository](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing). The original data for this story can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook) and it was collected from the website [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/) on 9/13/2017 by David Cohen so I owe a large thanks to David for making this project possible.
